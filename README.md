## Predicting ultra marathon times

This was my final project as part of the [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) Data Science course. It presents a problem statement, Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model creation, and finally a presentation in [revealjs](https://revealjs.com). All documents are then compiled using Quarto to render to HTML for viewing online here: [jmablog.github.io/ultra-marathons-analysis](https://jmablog.github.io/ultra-marathons-analysis)
